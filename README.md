## basic git workflow

- **pull** updates from the origin/remote repository/github to your local repository
- (repeat these steps as often as necessary/desired)
  - **work**
  - **save** new files and changes to your hard drive
  - (**add**) changes to gitâ€”tortoisegit does this graphically with checkboxes
  - **commit** changes to your local repository
- **push** changes to the origin/remote repository/github
