# 01 student information

You will use this assignment to gain familiarity with markdown, git, github, and assignment submission procedures. 

This example is publicly available so you can find it. Your responses will not be publicly available. 


## markdown instructions

Markdown is a text-based markup language. You can edit it in any text editor, but it’s easiest in a markdown editor such as marktext. 

In marktext, you can press `ctrl-e` at any time to toggle  source mode. Doing this in an existing file (such as this one) will reveal the syntax used for markdown features. 

Take a look at syntax for elements of this file. 

- multiple headers levels # for highest level ##, ### for lower levels
- `![personal photo](starship.jpg)` to insert an image
  - “personal photo” is alternate text describing the image. Tt might show up as mouseover text
  - “starship.jpg” is the name of the file. You can put include images in subfolders like this: “sources/starship.jpg”. 
- lists start with `dash space`
- short code snippets start and end with a back single quote `

For most syntax elements, marktext will correctly format the element even if you stay out of source code mode. To begin a list, type `dash space`. Marktext will automatically begin a list. To create a new list level, hit `tab` or `shift-tab`

## git instructions

Complete the student information assignment by editing `readme.md`. Edit in marktext. I will briefly discuss markdown and marktext in a later section. 

After you have completed the necessary changes:

- **save**
- right click in the directory -> **git commit**
- **add** new/changed files (by selecting check boxes)
- type a message -> **commit**
- **push** to remote repository

After you have pushed, request review via a **pull request** on github.com

- go to your personal repository
- click on pull requests
- select `feedback` pull request
- add your instructor as a reviewer
  ![](../sources/reviewer.png)
- add a comment like “01 student information ready for review”
- click comment 

**Note: Don’t click “merge pull request” or “close pull request.” Your instructor will close the pull request when you have successfully completed all assignments for Astro 201. **
