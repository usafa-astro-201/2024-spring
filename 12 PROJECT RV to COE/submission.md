# A201 Project—RV to COE

## documentation statement

## checklist

- [ ] project complete

All of the following are required in order to receive credit for completion. Your instructor will check off your completed sections and provide comments below or on the files you submit. Copy your work below this cover checklist.

- [ ] clear, concise, documented m-file code (all files)

- [ ] output file

- [ ] algorithms: 1 for the main script; 1 for each sub-function
  Could someone duplicate your program from this?

- [ ] correct answers for provided test cases in `RV1.dat`
  
  - [ ] create 2 tables of expected vs actual output: cases 1 & 2
  
  - [ ] case 1 must match values in `expected_output.txt`

- [ ] supporting hand calculations for case 2

- [ ] additional test cases and comparison table
  Explain why you needed extra test cases or why you didn’t. 

# Algorithms

Put your algorithms here. 

Each algorithm should be an H2-level heading. 

# Test Case Results

## case 1

### Input

# additional test cases

Explain why you did or did not need additional test cases. If necessary, include a table of results.
