# 21 Project COE Propagation

## documentation statement

## checklist

- [ ] project complete

All of the following are required in order to receive credit for completion. Your instructor will check off your completed sections and provide comments below or on the files you submit. Copy your work below this cover checklist.

- [ ] clear, concise, documented m-file code (all files)

- [ ] output file

- [ ] algorithms: 1 for the main script; 1 for each sub-function
  Could someone duplicate your program from this?

- [ ] clear, concise, documented m-file code

- [ ] correct answers for provided test cases in `RV2.dat`
  Cases 3 & 4 will need to be modified in `RV2.dat`to include a time of flight corresponding to the orbital period (in seconds)
  
  - [ ] Create a table of expected vs actual 
    (just true anomaly since it is the only new output)

- [ ] supporting hand calculations 

- [ ] additional test cases and comparison table
  Explain why you needed extra test cases or why you didnâ€™t. 
  Remember to test all cases of `coeupdate.m`

# Algorithms

Put your algorithms here for `COE_propagation.m` and all new functions. 

Provide an H2-level heading for each function. 

# test case results

|     | expected | actual |
| --- | -------- | ------ |
|     |          |        |
|     |          |        |
|     |          |        |
|     |          |        |
|     |          |        |

# hand calculations

(crop appropriately)

# additional test cases

Explain why you did or did not need additional test cases. If necessary, include a table of results.
