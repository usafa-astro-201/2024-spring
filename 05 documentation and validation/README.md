# A201 Exercise—Math Functions (part 2)



## authorized resources

 your instructor, your course notes, course materials and other cadets (but do not copy any of another cadet’s work)



## background

In this exercise you will document and validate the two functions that you wrote earlier:

- `mag.m`
- `vecangle.m`

### mag.m

`mag.m` will determine magnitude of a three-dimensional input vector. You will use this function extensively over your tenure as an engineering major.

### vecangle.m

`vecangle.m` takes two, three-dimensional input vectors and determines the angle between the two vectors using the following relationship:
$$
\vec{A} \cdot\vec{B} = |A||B|\cos\theta
$$
where $\theta$ is the angle between $\vec{A}$ and $\vec{B}$.



## tasks

1. **`mag.m`** Write an m-file function that will find the magnitude of a 3x1 vector.


   - input: vector (*not* separate variables for each component)


   - output:  vector magnitude





2) **`vecangle.m`** Write an m-file function that will find the angle between two input vectors.
   - inputs
     - Vector 1
     - Vector 2
   - output
     - The smaller (less than pi radians) angle between the two vectors
     - (must output radians)

 

## submittal

- [ ] documented code for both functions 
  - [ ] `mag.m`
  - [ ] `vecangle.m`

- [ ] test case results for both functions
- [ ] hand calculations for test cases (image in repository and insert in this file)



## test case results

### mag.m

| input     | output |
| --------- | ------ |
| [0, 0, 1] |        |
|           |        |
|           |        |



### vecangle.m

| input     | output |
| --------- | ------ |
| [0, 0, 1] |        |
|           |        |
|           |        |
