# 23 Project COE to RV

## documentation statment

## checklist

- [ ] project complete

All of the following are required in order to receive credit for completion. Your instructor will check off your completed sections and provide comments below or on the files you submit. Copy your work below this cover checklist.

- [ ] clear, concise, documented m-file code (all files)
- [ ] output file
- [ ] algorithms: 1 for the main script; 1 for each sub-function
  Could someone duplicate your program from this?
- [ ] correct answers for provided test cases in `RV2.dat`
  Cases 3 & 4 will need to be modified in `RV2dat`to include 1 orbit TOF as in the previous project.
  - [ ] Cases 1–4: Create a table of expected vs actual values for $\vec{R}_{ijk}$ and $\vec{V}_{ijk}$
    - [ ] include the output file in your repository
  - [ ] Case 5: Create a table of expected vs actual values for $\vec{R}_{pqw}$, $\vec{V}_{pqw}$, $\vec{R}_{ijk}$, and $\vec{V}_{ijk}$
    - [ ] supporting hand calculations for case 5
- [ ] additional sufficient test cases and comparison table
  - [ ] need at least a rotation test about the 2nd axis to ensure it works, because it isn’t used by the main project
  - [ ] Explain why you needed extra test cases or why you didn’t. 
    Remember to test all cases of `coeupdate.m`

# additional test cases

Explain why you did or did not need additional test cases. If necessary, include a table of results.
