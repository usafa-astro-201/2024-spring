# A201 Exercise—Math Functions (part 1)



## authorized resources

 your instructor, your course notes, course materials and other cadets (but do not copy any of another cadet’s work)



## background

We have discussed some of Matlab’s math functions and operations. In this exercise you will write two short m-files (each can be completed with 4 lines of code or less):

- `mag.m`
- `vecangle.m`

### mag.m

`mag.m` will determine magnitude of a three-dimensional input vector. You will use this function extensively over your tenure as an engineering major.

### vecangle.m

`vecangle.m` takes two, three-dimensional input vectors and determines the angle between the two vectors using the following relationship:
$$
\vec{A} \cdot\vec{B} = |A||B|\cos\theta
$$
where $\theta$ is the angle between $\vec{A}$ and $\vec{B}$.



## tasks

1. **`mag.m`** Write an m-file function that will find the magnitude of a 3x1 vector.


      - input: vector (*not* separate variables for each component)


      - output:  vector magnitude




2) **`vecangle.m`** Write an m-file function that will find the angle between two input vectors.
   - inputs
     - Vector 1
     - Vector 2
   - output
     - The smaller (less than pi radians) angle between the two vectors
     - (must output radians)

 

## submittal

- [ ] Code for `mag.m`
- [ ] Code for `vecangle.m`
