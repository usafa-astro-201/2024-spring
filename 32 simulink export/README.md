# A201 Exercise—simulink export

## authorized resources

 your instructor, your course notes, course materials and other cadets (but do not copy any of another cadet’s work)



## background 

We have discussed how to export data from Simulink. 

In this exercise you will produce a set of output values, export them to Matlab for plotting and then you will export them to an Excel spreadsheet and plot them there.



## tasks

Create a Simulink program that generates a sine wave and sends it to a “To Workspace” block and a “scope” block. 

Create 3 plots of output (y-axis) vs time (x-axis). Save each plot as an image and include in `readme.md`.



1. simulink scope output
    - export to figure
    - save figure as svg and include in `readme.md`
2. scripted matlab plot
    - `   plot(xaxisvariable,yaxisvariable)`
    - save and submit your script file
    - save figure as svg and include in `readme.md`
3. excel plot
    - copy data from workspace variable to excel
    - plot it
    - save a screenshot with `win`-`shift`-`S`
    - paste the screenshot into `readme.md` in marktext




## submittal 

- [ ] simulink model `numerical_integration.slx`
- [ ] matlab script file
- [ ] table of step sizes vs Y values
- [ ] truth value
- [ ] 3 plots
  - [ ] simulink scope
  - [ ] matlab plot
  - [ ] excel screenshot




## results 



### step size

| step size (s) | Y values |
| ------------- | -------- |
|               |          |
|               |          |
|               |          |



### truth value

(include at least 6 digits right of the decimal)



## figure

use this syntax to add your image: `![]()`
