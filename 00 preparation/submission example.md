You will submit each homework assignment via github. Homework assignments can have multiple files. They will all be included in the same folder and uploaded (pushed) to github. 

- **`readme.md`** Every submission will include this main file. It will serve as a coverpage, and checklist. It may also include some parts of the assignment itself. It is a markdown file--a plain text format that allows for simple formatting and image insertion. 
  - Your title will include an H1 header (`# text`)
  - Sections will be separated by an H2 header (`## text`)
  - **algorithms** if applicable, algorithm(s) will be included as a section in `readme.md`
  - **result tables** if applicable, create a table for expected vs actual values
  - **hand calculations** if applicable, include a scan of your hand calculations. You must save the file in the assignment folder and also include it in `readme.md` in a **hand calculations section**. 
- **code** include your matlab files (`*.m`)
- **test case output** if applicable, include output file for provided test cases (`output1.txt`).
  If applicable, include any graphs as image files and insert them into `readme.md`
- **test case output** include output file for additional sufficient test cases (`output2.txt`)



# EXAMPLE Project Submittal Sheet

## PROJECT RV to COEs

## Cadet Name

- [ ] Project Complete         



Note: All of the following are required in order to receive credit for completion. Your instructor will check off your completed sections and provide written comments in a pull request on github. 



- [ ] Algorithms (1 for the main script file and 1 for each sub-function. Could someone duplicate your program from this?)

- [ ] Clear, Concise and Documented m-file Code
  - include all necessary files

- [ ] Correct Answers for Provided Test Cases in RV1.dat.  (Create a table of expected vs actual values and attach copies of the output files and “hand calculations.”)

- [ ] Additional Sufficient Test Cases and Comparison Table (State why you had to add extra test cases, or why you didn’t.)



This format applies to all assignments.  Not all of them will have this many parts.



## Algorithms

Include in this file (`readme.md`) the algorithms for your main program and and algorithms for any applicable sub-functions.

### Main algorithm

Each algorithm should have its own H3 header in the Algorithms section. 

### Algorithm for a sub-function

 

## Results

Include table of test cases (including expected values, actual values, pass/fail)



| animal | says | does    |
| ------ | ---- | ------- |
| cat    | meow | sleeps  |
| dog    | woof | fetches |



## Hand calculations 

Clear photos are acceptable. Crop appropriately. Note: this example is not cropped appropriately.

View source code for image syntax. This image is in a folder `sources` folder, but that is not necessary for simple projects like Astro 201 assignments. 



## Additional Test Cases

All “if” checks were tested true and false and all lines of the code were tested.
